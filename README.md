I'm currently just throwing finance things here to avoid losing them in my computer, in some random folder or some untitled459.ipynb. I don't know if this is going to be something or not.

I haven't bothered to make different branches, so some things are working correctly and some are not. Once this repo is more usable I will make sure to only have correct code in the master branch, but not yet :) 

Enjoy.
