I'm currently just throwing finance things here to avoid losing them in my computer, in some random folder or some untitled459.ipynb. I don't know if this is going to be something or not.

Current status: I think `gmb.py` and `binomial.py` are correct, but I don't even remember what I was doing with `vol_estimators.py`. 

Enjoy.
